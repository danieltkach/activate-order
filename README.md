# activate-order
Quick script that I created to solve an issue at work. We had a shopify website where people purchased our digital products, which had to be activated in Kajabi.
Zapier did not have the option to connect the two as the company needed, so I created this script that maps Shopify product SKUs using a Googlesheet (for which I learned to use the API) to a Kajabi webhook. 
I'm particularly proud of this little simple thing as other programmers the company hired couldn't make it, while myself, a programing hobbiest could. I just learned enough Python in order to do this.
